<p>While I was growing up, my dad was an art student.</p>
<p>My earliest memories are posing for photos or trailing behind him as he conversed with his peers. I remember 
    <br>sitting in the garage and watching him paint, music blaring from his iPod and the smell of chemicals burning my nostrils.
    <br>Eventually, his interest deviated towards photography, instead.</p>
<p>Between all of my siblings, I was the most willing participant for sitting still while he took photos.</p>
<p>It helped that every time he took a photo, he'd give me a skittle.</p>

<p>I had an interest in drawing from a young age. I looked up to my dad a lot, since some of my earliest memories were of
    <br>sitting on the futon in the garage while I watched him paint. I really wanted him to like the things I was drawing,
    <br>but he pushed me to create my own original work while I preferred drawing my World of Warcraft characters.</p>
