<p>When I was around ten years old, my older sister received a drawing tablet. I was really excited about this, even if<br>
it wasn't my gift. It worked out anyway since she didn't use it most of the time (though she still had to deal with my pleading<br>
to use her computer when I was not fighting my brother to use the family computer), and since my dad was a photographer I had access<br>
to applications like Photoshop. I made a DeviantArt account which I used to share art with my peers at school. I liked cats a lot<br>
and was a fan of the <i>Warriors</i> series by Erin Hunter at the time.</p>
