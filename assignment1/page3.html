<p>All of my friends from elementary school ended up going to a different middle school than I did<br>
and I was artistically left to my own devices. I returned to drawing characters, and since<br>
digital art was much easier to share than traditional (think markers, pens, paint) I would share it with the<br>
people I played with in World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>While I was in high school, I realized that people were interested in commissioning me. A commission, in<br>
the digital art space, refers to you drawing what ever a client wants in exchange for money or some other compensation.<br>
This became my first "job", in a sense, and I could use that money to pay for my game subscription and save up for my own computer.</p>
<p>(My dad made sure to let me know he thought I was a sell out for doing this.)</p>
