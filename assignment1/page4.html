<p>"Do what you like, not what you love."</p>
<p>This saying was fairly apt for my situation. As I took on more commissions I realized it <br>
was bleeding away my passion for my hobby. At the same time, I ended up developing
<br>carpal tunnel in both of my wrists and would experience a lot of back pain due to my shrimp-like
<br>posture while sitting at the computer.</p>
<p>I went on a hiatus, save for two art classes in community college. I realized I enjoyed programming
<br>there after taking an introductory computer science class, and that lead to me majoring in computer
<br>science here at Western. I would maybe only finish one illustration per year for about two years.
