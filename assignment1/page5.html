<p>About a month ago, an old friend from World of Warcraft reached out to me and told me about how our guild
<br>was having a reunion. Despite how long it had been (I was not even playing WoW anymore at this point)
<br>he still used the picture of his character I made for him several years ago as a profile picture (see first image).
</p>
<p>I felt really touched by this, and it made me remember one of the things I liked so much about drawing:
<br>making something for other people to make them happy. I made him an updated version to use instead, and
<br>I started drawing the characters of my current friends both as a way to figure out what my artistic
<br>process would look like going forward and as a gift to them.
</p>
<p>I definitely don't have the free time to draw like I used to, but I'm glad to have reconnected with a
<br>hobby that was very important to me.
