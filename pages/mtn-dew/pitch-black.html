                    <p>I had a lot of issues with Pitch Black. First of all, it's purple. Second, apparently MTN Dew's parent company held a vote between Baja Blast and Pitch Black. The winner would be sold in stores permanently. Very unfortunate for me, Pitch Black was the winner.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to try it and see what the adversary to one of my favorite beverages was like. Unfortunately, they only sold it in six-packs in the size of the above photo. I bit the bullet and purchased them, knowing that even if I did not like them I would still have to drink them all, anyway.</p>
                    <p>Fitting for its color scheme, the first bottle was abysmal. It tasted like watered down, bubbly cough medicine with a citrus cough drop dissolved in it. Turning it into a slushy helped its flavor profile somewhat, and begrudgingly I finished the first bottle.</p>
                    <p>I don't know what came over me, but even though I did not enjoy it, I started to crave it. I had my second bottle ice cold, and I was taken aback by how much I liked it. It was almost as good as Baja Blast, if not just as good.</p>
                    <p>I consumed all six bottles in the span of two days. This resulted in the worst sugar withdrawal of my life. The migraines were exquisite. I would give this a higher ranking but it's not actually pitch black.</p>
