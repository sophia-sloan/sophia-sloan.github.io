                    <p>I'm not going to have any illusions that MTN Dew is particularly good for you (see my ranking on Pitch Black), but the toxic sludge green really does convey to you the message that you are essentially just drinking poison.</p>
                    <p>This usually isn't a problem for me but this poison does not taste very good. Regular MTN Dew tastes like a chartreuse desolation. It's flavors are sharp and abrasive in a way that wants to be a citrus, lemon flavor but is just a twisted amalgam of something else. It tastes like the rainy sidewalk of a 1990's dystopian sci-fi film. It tastes like Fallout back when it was still turn-based.</p>
                    <p>I feel almost obligated to like regular MTN Dew as someone who has played video games for over one hundred hours in a single week on countless occasions but I can't bring myself to do it.</p>
